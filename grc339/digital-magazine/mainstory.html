                            <h2>The Raw Attractiveness Of Industrial Interior Design</h2>
                        
                            <p>Think of a warehouse. Think of worn-out wood flooring, brick walls, and metal bars exposed from the ceiling. Now, think of converting that into an office, or a home.</p>

                            <p>This might seem like a crazy idea at first. But there's a beautiful name for this today—modern industrial design. There's something about industrial details that wouldn't go away: the charm of uncompleted interiors, the raw finishes, and the appeal of a design age that centers on mechanical ingenuity. Incorporating industrial interiors into your condo home has certain oomph to it. It's a gorgeous way to combine modern design with age-old materials that look as cool as ever.</p>
                            
                            <p>The industrial interior design style is undoubtedly on the uprise in the past couple of years. Its unfinished look and functionality have captured the hearts of interior trend buffs from all over the world. So what exactly is the secret of this quite unusual style and what makes it one of the most beloved interior design trends at the moment? </p>

                            <p>Think large spacious rooms with high ceilings, dangling metal lighting fixtures, and visible old timber here and there. Industrial design spaces will always look kinda unfinished, but kinda not. The unfinished vibe ends with its appearance, but you will never feel like the space itself lacks something. “Unfinished finished” is what I'd call it. </p>

                            <p>One of the reasons why industrial design trends are a hit these days is because of the raw simplicity it connotes. If a home attempting to look industrial has all sorts of clutter, from bulky furniture to a load of knick knacks, industrial details can't reveal themselves.</p>
                            
                            <p>This makes it a good way to maximize condo space. A place would look bigger if there's not much happening. Industrial elements are very strong and you should not overdo it. It is stripped-back architecture. A wrought iron canopy bed in your bedroom, a bike hooked on your living room wall, and wooden bar stools around your kitchen table are good enough centerpieces.</p>
                            
                            <p>Industrial designs require little furniture and more floor space. This design genre wants people to be able to move around, like you can park a motorcycle inside and it would still be okay.</p>

                            <p>Industrial elements can be vintage or rustic. Never mind that they came from an older architectural genre. Industrial design elements will look good when balanced with modern fixtures.</p>
                            
                            <p>In your kitchen, for example, where you obviously don't cook on top of stones and inside bricks anymore, use the shiny metal quality of appliances to provide an interesting contrast with rustic metals. Pendant lighting using Edison-style bulbs, brass-type knobs on cabinets, and an island made of wood that looks like it's just been chopped off a tree would give your modern kitchen an industrial twist.</p>
                            
                            <p>A white couch against a wall with rustic artwork should look good in your living room. A floor lamp made of metallic materials such as brushed nickel copper provide contrast to contemporary carpeting. Remember that it's all in the details.</p>
                            
                            <p>As for the furnishing, it is sparse at most. By that, I don't mean it is minimalistic and impractical, but simply — functional. Highly functional. Wood and metal are the usual choices when it comes to Industrial design, but no one will judge you if you add a comfy cushioned sofa in front of your TV. The aim is to achieve balance. To avoid minimalistic coldness, as well as that maximalist sense of overdoing everything to the point of hoarding. Just think — functional.</p>

                            <p>As for the color palette, bare building surfaces add their own colors, but the color most Industrial design enthusiasts go for is gray. It might have something to do with trying to achieve that metallic look on most surfaces. Weathered gray walls, gray furniture covers, and gray decor, in general, is always welcome if you are going for the Industrial vibe.</p>
                        
                            <p>As for the decor itself — the less, the better. You don't want anything to draw the attention of the naked materials because they should be the key component in your space. So if you want to have that Industrial look in your home, the first thing that should go are those lovely floral curtains you bought on a whim or that fluffy carpet that never looked the same after you washed it. Just think — naked. You won't be wrong and you might end up having some fun in the process.</p>
