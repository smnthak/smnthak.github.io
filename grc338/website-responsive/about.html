                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Established at the start of 2022, SereniTea was created to serve premium tea in the San Luis Obispo area. The Kim sisters, Sarah and Sam, shared a love for boba tea, however, it grew their standards for what a good cup of tea is. They started making their own boba at home with quality loose leaf teas and homemade products. As their expertise developed, friends and family encouraged them to open a boba shop. Growing up in the Bay Area, the Kim sisters found that there was no place in San Luis Obispo that was serving the premium boba they were looking for. So, they decided to build SereniTea to offer it themselves.</p>
